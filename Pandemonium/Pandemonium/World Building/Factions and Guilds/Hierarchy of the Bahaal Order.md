#### Os

The lowest rank among the clergy of the Bahaal Order. The Os are used to spread their religious ideology to all of the peoples of the seven realms and beyond. They are a non-combative cast among the clergy but have extremely high charisma, occasionally practicing charisma based magik.

#### Auris

The next rank of the clergy, the Auris are the inquisitors that route out the heretics among their own order. The Auris are also responsible for prosecuting the enemies of the church, including the many undead and aberrations that have been plaguing the realms.

#### Manus

The hands of the Bahaal Order, the Manus are the enforcers that compose the Army of Souls. The Manus are responsible for defending the many religious buildings and personnel of the clergy. The Manus are occasionally called upon to conduct holy wars against enemies of the church.

#### Sacerdos

The Sacerdos are second only to the Genetrix. They are responsible for creating and communicating the religious doctrine of the order. The Sacerdos are immensely powerful casters who receive their powers from Bahaal directly, using this power to lead the clergy of the seven cities of Bahaal. Together, the seven Sacerdos and Genetrix form the Council of the Blind.

#### Genetrix

The Genetrix is the matriarch of the Bahaal Order. The Genetrix is selected by the Council of the Blind after the passing of the former Genetrix. They are selected when the council searches within their realms for a young female that shows a birthmark of an eye on the back of their neck. The Genetrix is the most powerful caster of the order and is a direct link to Bahaal, often considered to be their avatar.
