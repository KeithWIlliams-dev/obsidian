Aegir is the spirit of the sea. Aegir is said to be the spirit who uplifted the Aegiri from their small islands and taught them fishing as well as sailing and navigation. 

Aegir is said to have been born of the turmoil of the seas, becoming the avatar or manifestation of the oceans and their inhabitants. Aegir is said to have had command of the many creatures and beasts of the sea, guarding those who pray or pay tribute to Aegir.

At the time of [[The Calamity]] a gargantuan beast known as [[The Leviathan]] began terrorizing sea farers and threatening to destroy [[The Nation of Aegir]]. Aegir became locked into a great battle with [[The Leviathan]] and now sits at the bottom of the ocean preventing [[The Leviathan]] from escaping and wreaking havoc on the seas.

Because Aegir is locked in eternal battle, the many beasts of the seas began attacking the many people who sail the seas. Aegir is unable to stop these beast, but legend has it that those who still pray or offer tribute to Aegir give him the strength to continue the eternal battle with [[The Leviathan]] and may provide calm seas, clear skies, or bountiful catch.
