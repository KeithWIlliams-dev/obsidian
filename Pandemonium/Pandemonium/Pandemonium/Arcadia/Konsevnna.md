Konsevenna is one of the largest cities in the world ([[Population]]) that also houses the largest [[Kathedra]] in the world. Konsevenna was founded at the [[Stright of Io]] by the Arcadians in 83 BA ([[Belian Calendar]]). 

Konsevenna was where the second [[High Mother]] was found, [[Gonk Sun]] (0 AA), at the age of four. Gonk Sun greatly increased the power and size of Konsevenna, even building the largest [[Kathedra]] and enclosing the city in the worlds largest walls.

Konsevenna later lost its seat as the home of the [[High Mother]] at the eve of the new High Mothers ascension to power (36 AA). The city continued to build itself as one of the largest influences on the world for the [[Church of Bahaal]].
