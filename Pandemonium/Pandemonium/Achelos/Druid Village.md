Saprophyte: The home village of the circle of spores, the smallest circle of the druidic magiks. The village is made of underground burrows connected by small tunnels, creating an underground network with small breaches into the surface.

  

The village is headed by an elder, Mother Esther, who is a Grand Druid of the order. 

Ofos and Ontezos are the childhood friends of Olvir
