As of late, the commune has been experiencing random disappearances of their cattle, and even as of latest, one of their memebers [[Dirtlegs Jorgil ]]. Dirtlegs disappeared last night and only her flute was found.

Dirtlegs was taken by a barbed devil, one of the minions of the Bone Devil [[Sinoth the Blood Sucker]].
[[Sinoth the Blood Sucker]] has two barbed devils and two lesser imps that carry out his will. These tasks include raiding villages livestock, stealing gold and artifacts, and abducting souls for sacrafice.

[[Sinoth the Blood Sucker]] is currently in Firth to feed on the commune and thier livestock, but having quenched their lust for blood they now seek souls to increase their power and rank among the armies of the damned.

[[Sinoth the Blood Sucker]] abducted [[Dirtlegs Jorgil]] to consume her soul, the first of many souls to sacrafice.

The minions of [[Sinoth the Blood Sucker]] are evil and follow out their commands, however as all devils are, they are greedy and will betray those above thim to take their place.
